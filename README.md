# CyvClient
CyvClient is a custom Minecraft 1.8.9 Parkour Client containing revamped MPKMod and MorphMPK features, as well as a range of useful mods and features used by most players.
This client performs slightly better than Forge, thus serving as an alternative to the normal MPKMod setup.

This client is currently in closed beta, a public release will come soon.

### Installation
1. Download the Zip File corresponding to the version you wish to use.
2. Take the folder inside (should be named **CyvClient**) and place it inside your **/.minecraft/versions** folder.
3. Go to the 'Releases' page on GitHub and download the CyvClient.jar file from the latest version.
4. Then drag the downloaded CyvClient.jar file into the 'CyvClient' version folder.
5. Open up the Minecraft Launcher and in the 'Installations' tab, create a new launcher profile (or installation).
6. Give the new installation a name, then under 'VERSION' find 'release CyvClient' then click 'Install'.

*NOTE: if you already have CyvClient installed, follow the steps under **Updating** ignore the version zip file.*

### Updating
Download the Cyv_Version_Profile.zip and CyvClient.jar file as usual, grab the CyvClient.json file from inside the Cyv_Version_Profile folder and along with the newly downloaded CyvClient.jar file, replace your two existing files in **/.minecraft/versions** with the new ones. You do not need to recreate the launcher profile.
