# CyvClient
CyvClient is a custom Minecraft 1.8.9 Parkour Client containing revamped MPKMod and MorphMPK features, as well as a range of useful mods and features used by most players.
This client performs slightly better than Forge, thus serving as an alternative to the normal MPKMod setup.

This client is currently in closed beta, a public release will come soon.
