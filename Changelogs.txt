Finished features (in order of completion - all of these are either DONE or specified as TESTING) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Add 3-12 tick turn labels 
	- (Iteration 8) - Minor change to turn angles making them function more like MPKmod2's 3-12 turn angles 
			 (previous iteration precalculated next airtick's turn angle when current tick's angle was received, resulting in wrong calculations for a tick). 
2. Save current game sensitivity to Control Presets too (TESTING) 
	- (FOUND) BUG #1 - Sometimes Control Presets do not save to their correct slots (ex: controls for 'valor' preset suddenly become those for 'd11 loop' preset) 
		- Not entirely sure how this bug occurs, sometimes it occurs when changing versions other times it doesn't, it can also randomly happen even if booting up the same version.
			- Bug instance #1: The jar file for CyvClient is swapped (with major changes)
			- Bug instance #2: When I switch Minecraft versions
				- (FOUND BUG) when switching MC versions or ControlPreset.json files the controls from the previous instance of MC overwrites whatever current Preset is active 
					- IDEA TO FIX: don't save previous preset of previous instance of MC when loading all presets in during current instance of MC.
		  I don't really have a fix for this atm except whenever the jar file is swapped/updated make sure to keep a backup copy of the .minecraft/cyvclient folder 
		- Even after reading the backup copy of the CyvClient folder the sensitivity still resets to 0 for some reason (check this out later)
3. Fix the better crosshair addon's option to light up when looking at entity (TESTING)
	- (FIXED?) BUG #1 - I had a crash during my first iteration using it but am not entirely sure how the crash happened. There should be a few crash reports on this in the logs.
		- (Iteration 4) I think fixed this bug by swapping around getting entity data (?) and something else (needs more testing to be sure - update: haven't crashed in over a month using it, might be fixed)
4. Add 'Grounded' Label (lights up RED when in air or GREEN if on ground) 
	- (FIXED - Iteration 4) BUGFIX: Have PRETURN label be first (before JA and 2-12 turn labels)
	- Also added input history between this iteration and the next iteration (haven't finished all of the features )
5. Add a 'Runtime' label that displays the amount of ticks player 'runs' for (check how HH timing is calculated - might be useful) 
6. Add mark timings to Last Sidestep label (TESTING)
7. Fixed a few bugs with Control Presets and also made a few quality of life changes (Note: if changing versions switch preset to DEFAULT or some preset that you don't mind being overwritten))
	1. Properly displays relevant text when renaming or creating a new preset. Previously when adding or renaming a preset it displays the same text 
	   ('Account Switcher' at the top -> Now should display either 'Create New Preset' and 'Rename Selected Preset' at the top)
	   ('Create' button -> displays 'Create' text when creating a new preset and 'Rename' text when renaming a preset)
	2. After adding a new preset, the new preset should be selected instead of the original preset
	3. Fixed bug where deleting a preset in Control Presets deletes the desired preset in the GUI, however the actual controls for the preset below it gets deleted instead 
  		(likely because the preset below shifts into the deleted one's position?)
		- The preset below the deleted one takes on its controls and the controls for that preset gets deleted instead
		- The other presets above and below these two seem unaffected 
		- (info) When you remove a preset, press 'back', the removed preset is still active. Then when you go back to choose another preset from here, it works normally.
			- If you remove a preset, and immediately choose another preset. The removed preset's controls will overwrite the preset immediately below it (that moved up into its position).
			- If you remove a preset at the end of the list, the removed preset's controls will overwrite controls of the preset immediately above it
8. Added minimal view bobbing addon that overwrites vanilla Minecraft View Bobbing setting
9. Fixed bug that occurs when raw input is on while mouse disconnects which caused mouse to stop moving, even after reconnecting. Previously you have to restart the game to fix this.
	- Added /cyv rescan command to client to fix this. Whenever mouse disconnect happens, use this command to regain movement.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features to add/Bugs to fix ('-->' = currently working on, '-' = will be added but not now, '-?' = idk/check with hpk staff)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> Add /getPosition command that copies current coordinates/facing to clipboard
--> Add label that displays coordinates of target block
--> Create a label/addon that displays player inputs for number of held ticks (as a viewable/constantly changing list of inputs in-game) (IN-DEVELOPMENT)
DONE	- Will only save inputs for 'WASD' 'Sneak' 'Sprint' 'Jump' 
DONE	- holding down same inputs will increment tick count. 'ticks #:' will not be visible, just here for demonstration purposes 
		Example (for 3t hh):
		- tick 1: W Sprint (3t)
		- tick 4: W Sprint Jump (1t)
		- tick 5: W Sprint (*t) -> player releases space bar on next tick and * means to continue incrementing until player changes inputs
		Example (for Rex bwmm)
		- tick 1: S Jump Sprint (1t)
		- tick 2: S Sprint (11t)
		- tick 13: WA Jump Sprint (1t)
		- tick 14: W Sprint Jump (*t)
DONE	- No activity (All inputs pressed for 999 ticks will result in '999t+' essentially stopping the tick counter until new inputs registered) 
		- if toggle-sprint/sneak is enabled then time inputs out? 
 		- Question: What should we do about inactivity or if player holds down the button for too long? 
			- I.e. Doing nothing will also increment tick count (since some jumps require wait 1t etc.)
			- I.e. toggle sprint enabled means 'Sprint' will able be held -> then player goes afk -> tick count goes up infinitely
			time out inactivity after like 100 ticks?
DONE	- Should have an option to increase/decrease size of label (size of the entire label)
DONE	- Should have an option in cyvclient settings to change number of input lines displayed on the screen at once (1-50 lines) [Fade out doesn't work with drawstring function - alpha not recognized]
		- number of input lines should determine height of list
DONE	- Should display either turn amount or current facing on top of user input (have an option for both) next to inputs. Make this feature optional/can be disabled too.
		Options (Summarized above bullet point):	
		- display current facing (f coord)
		- display turn amount difference between current and last ticks
		- display both
		- display neither
		Should look like this (Both): 
		- [10t W A S D Spr Snk Jmp f45(-30)] <-- 10 is the number of ticks the input stayed the same       
WIP	- Add a keybind that pauses/unpauses the current input list (stops receiving new inputs and also stops erasing old inputs)
WIP	- Add option to pause input list upon landing a jump
WIP	- Add option to display arrows instead of WASD like in kurrycat's mpk mod
DONE	- Add an option (enable/disable) that if player right clicks (uses cp) then input history will reset
DONE	- Add an option (enable/disable) that makes inputs stay until they get deleted (no tick age) [TESTING]
DONE	- Add slider for input visibility length (how long the input stays visible for after new inputs come in 10 - 300 ticks)
DONE	- (BUG) InputHistory should be a parkour mod/addon, it should NOT be in the general category
WIP	- Add 'Input History' text on the input history box itself (up/down arrow -> isInverted)
WIP	- Add 'Color' option for ticks, keys inputs, and facing/turn angles (each would be separate)
WIP? 	-? Add a keybind/command/button (maybe all 3) that saves current input history as macro file (probably too complicated to implement tbh)
		- if this can be done, maybe also increase input history size from 50 MAX to 100 MAX or something
WIP?	-? (Somehow) add a indicator/label that lights up green/red when user correctly does a set of inputs 
		- May have to implement a separate GUI for jumps that are more lenient? 
		  (idk how to go about this, if too difficult to implement or is considered cheating, scrap this idea)
WIP	- Add XYZ coordinates to input history (toggleable)

-? Add an in game customizable metronome (20 sounds per second for # of ticks and user can add as many seconds as they need and change which of the 20 sounds play in each second? (concept idea))
	- feature: resets metronome upon right click (checkpoint)
	- End Goal: Turn MCPK into a rhythm game (lmao)
-? Add a button (somewhere) that allows user to save all current Label positions and visibility as a preset (similar to Control Presets)
-? Finish adding dynamic surrounding sounds (review Dynamic surrounding mod 1.8.9 source code on GitHub)
-? Give player the ability to change size of labels and also group together labels to drag around (like selecting multiple files in file explorer for example)
	- May be too difficult to do (if major overhaul is required, abandoned this idea)
- (BUG) when scrolling down in GUI, mod settings (gear icon) gets displaced and lights up above actual hover location

-? Add ingame journal/notepad addon + keybind. Should be able to create as many notebooks/journals as needed. Should have regular text actions (copy, paste, highlight, middle text edit, etc.)
-? Add option for togglesprint to UNTOGGLE sprint whenever sprint key is held while toggle sprint is enabled (basically the opposite of togglesprint)
-? Add the ability to create subsections/folders in stratreminders mod for better organization
-? Add 'Schematica reload' mod (or at least a cheap copy of it to make rebuilding jumps easier? idk might be too difficult)
-? Add something that changes colors of certain specified labels when in a set range of values (user specified)
-? Add 'AutoCP' toggle to anti-cp mod, automatically sets cp on landing a jump (OJ)
-? Add a way to randomized /unprac whenever prac item is used (randomly unpracs when activated)
- Add a /record start/stop command and keybind 
- Add a /clip command and keybind 
- Add option to SAVE current macro (If name isn't changed it will be saved as 'name#' and should update text field in game too)
-? Add 'Custom Timing' Label that functions the same as Last Timing but also displays USER created timings (should use the same files used to run macros)
- Create GUI that allows you to make presets/profiles that saves current landing block, current landing condition, current pb, current mm block, etc., and allows you to load them whenever you want 
	- these should be saved even after closing the game.
- (BUG) Make vertical rotate effect ALL lines in a strat (not just a single line)
- (BUG) fix 'depth' toggle in stratreminder mod (allows strats to be seen through walls)
- (Bug) Make strats only render in when the player is nearby (add a slider to determine how large the render radius around the player should be)
