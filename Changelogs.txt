Major Changes:
- Added Customizable Sounds for Vanilla minecraft, CyvClient, and Dynamic Surroundings under QOL config settings and DSMod settings (Only a select few sounds for CyvClient and current DS mod)

Minor Changes:
- Changed StratReminder render range from 10-80 blocks to 5-50 blocks away
- Increased max AntiCP delay time to 5.0s
- Added toggleable sound effect for landing jump (in Parkour category config - CyvClient sound)
- Adding size slider to custom sidebar mod

Bugfixes
- Fixed Account Switcher for java jdks which have JavaFX included (BellSoft-Liberica-Full-8 for example).
  Adding new accounts using Account Switcher doesn't work if you don't use a jdk with JavaFX, since it needs to open up a Microsoft login Webview.
